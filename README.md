## Notes

- Internal documentation missing.
- Not all of them fit into the required algorithmic complexity.
- Code could have been refactored to improve understandability after been solved in the given time.

## Development

All problems are solved using Java 8 and [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
